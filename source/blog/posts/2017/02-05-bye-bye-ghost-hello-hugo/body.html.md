Hello from Hugo! I had tried Ghost for a while but eventually I abandonded it.. it's funny
because after leaving Jekyll for Ghost I thought I would never come back to static sites generators,
yet here I am again.

I have to admit that although Ghost seemed promising, its development was way too slow, plus
many breaking changes: they announced 1.0.0 edition about a month ago, it's still under very heavy
development, many many things change (no breaking changes though), mostly visually and stable release
date is unknown. At the same time they announced that post 1.0.0 will break almost everything including
the db, without an official migration plan! Oh well..

Hugo seems super simple and fast actually. Meanwhile, vim has a much better markdown plugin and
hugo makes it super easy to review the changes (hot reloading) so static website it is for now.

Let's see how far it will take us..

PS: I have lost some older posts unfortunately, too bad I didn't take any backup of ghost's db.
One more reason why it seems static sites is the way to go -> git.
