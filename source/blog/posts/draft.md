There are 3 types of denouncers of REST model.

1. The ones who understand what REST is and feel that due to its complexity, they prefer loosing some features and deliver something
simpler, yet easier to implement and test and deliver a RESTy approach.
2. The ones who understand what REST brings on the table but given that they control the client as well,
why should they bother with the whole HATEOAS thing?
3. The ones who don't understand REST and just want a plain JSON because it's simple enough for their needs.
