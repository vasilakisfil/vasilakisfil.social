        A talk again specifically for MicroTypes was hosted in APIDays in Paris,
        that was targeted to more advanced audience and covered the whole
        MicroTypes concept with rigid definition of each property along with its implementation in HTTP.
        Towards the end we discussed new paradigms that such architecture could lead (i.e. introspecting capabilities of HTTP APIs for configurability, discovery of capabilities etc).

        Unfortunately no video or recorded audio of this talk is available although it was very interesting talk because I could finally explain the whole concept
        without fearing that I will lose the audience. Lesson learned: next time I give a talk and I don't see cameras I will record the audio of my talk with my phone..

      <p class="title is-5"> MicroTypes: Composability in HTTP APIs</p>
      <p class="subtitle is-6"><em>Nordic APIs conference, October 2017.</em></p>

      <p class="has-text-justified margin-top-3 margin-bottom-5">
        Microtypes in combination with reactive negotiation, a forgotten but still valid negotiation mechanism in HTTP,
        can give us enormous possibilities when designing a new API by allowing the API designers to tailor the API
        capabilities to their needs while at the same time it enables clients to negotiate parts of the API functionality
        that are only interested or understand and not the Media Type as a whole. Choosing between REST or GraphQL wonâ€™t
        be necessary as APIs can support both styles progressively, simultaneously, or asymmetrically for different
        classes of clients, using multiple sets of MicroTypes.
        There is a video version available as well from the talk.

      <p class="title is-5"> Sliding away from Roy Fielding's REST model</p>
      <p class="subtitle is-6"><em>Nordic APIs conference, October 2016.</em></p>

      </div>

      <p class="has-text-justified margin-top-3 margin-bottom-5">
        We go through what a modern REST API is, see what are the least features we should provide to the clients,
        how we can test it super fast (because testing APIs can be very time consuming!) and how we can optimize it's performance.
        The talk is not bound to any specific API spec (JSONAPI, Serien, HAL etc) but goes though all the principles of a modern REST API.

        However it challenges Roy Fieldings's thesis on REST APIs (is it still valid, 17 years later?) along with current specs which are
        based on Roy's thesis (like JSONAPI spec) especially when high performance is part of the API design.

        There is a video version available as well from that talk.

        Discusses best practices for building, testing and optimizing modern APIs.
        Ruby and Rails is used in the slides but the practices should be the same regadless the language.

        It reflects Videofy's backend we built in the end of 2015.
