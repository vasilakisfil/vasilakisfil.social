        I am a software engineer who loves crafting web services.
        Worked mostly with Ruby and Javascript, but familiar with C/Go/Java/C++ as well.
        REST APIs specialist.
        Optimizing services for low latency and high throughput is my thing. Pure interest in networks and services.
        I am also very experienced with remote working, having worked in a remote-first company for many years.
